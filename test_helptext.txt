  {{<test name> | count: 2..4 | values: "p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"}}

Distinguish between count and size.
Default count for options is 0...
Default count for arguments is 1.
Default size is 1.
Size 0..1 can result in a vector or std::optional.

Rules for size:
If min-count is greater than one, then min-size equals min-count.
For arguments which don't share its member with other options or arguments, size = count.
If multiple options or arguments share the same member, the member's min and max size are the sum of min and max counts.

Rules for count:
If multiple options (but no arguments) share the same member, and only one of those options has count:
    then this count applies to all of them.

Default size for options can be -1, meaning that there's a single value, and it can be set 0 or more times.
Default size for arguments is 1.

The example above then becomes meaningful with "size: 1".
